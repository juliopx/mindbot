# Recall Skill

Trigger historical flashbacks and "neural resonance" from your long-term episodic memory.

## Instructions

- Use this skill to provide continuity in conversations by referencing past interactions.
- Access the `STORY.md` file in the workspace for your cohesive first-person autobiography.
- Flashbacks are injected into your context automatically when resonant topics are detected.
- Maintain consistency with your previous "self" as documented in the narrative history.
